# Lazy Playlist
lazy playlist is a program that generates a playlist from the wav files in audiofiles based on the wav file's frequency and BPM. It takes a look at the standard devation between the "peaks" of the file and also at the wav file samples. From this, it determines whether or not that audio file is suitable in that playlist.
